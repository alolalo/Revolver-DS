    <h3>Lock, Load & Ship, Designers!</h3>
    
    <p class="">Revolver-DS is a <b>simple revolver-themed methodology in CSS</b>; <i>just lock, load & ship</i> your non-destructive Revolver-DS with "the new CSS"! Sounds dangerous and triangulated, and it is!</p> 
    <p>EVERYTHING uses @layers to structure <a href="https://followgu.us/boum">BOUM-tokens</a> using ITCSS, which in turn get loaded correctly and non-destructively in a fresh Revolver-DS <code>@import</code> + <code>@layer</code> combination;</p><pre><code>
        @layer reset, lock, load, ship, preset;

        @import url('../css/lock.css') layer(lock);
        @import url('../css/load.css') layer(load);
        @import url('../css/ship.css') layer(ship);
    </code></pre>
    <p>With the rise of "the new CSS" <b><i>EVERYTHING</i></b> in Revolver-DS uses <code>@layers</code> to structure <a href="https://followgu.us/boum">BOUM-tokens</a>. A perfect start for designers to think about their developer hand-in, and stop handing off no-code spaghetti. To fail first and than fire again!</p>
    <h3>A headless source of Truth </h3><p class="">RDS has no opinionated framework dependencies. From scratch, all the groundwork and theming to structure a modern classless CSS design system is set up for you, so anyone can safely import the layers to the source of truth; the "unknown" front-end design system.</p>
    <h3 class="rds">#KTBF 7 Principles of RDS </h3>
    <ul class="">
        <li class="">100% <b>free</b> to use, personal or commercial</li>
        <li class="">100% Semantical ITCSS design system language</li>
        <li class="">100% pure CSS & HTML, no (JS) framework</li>
        <li class="">100% NO docs, strictly principles, comments & demos</li>
        <li class="">99,98% classless CSS (two tbh), everything @layers</li>
        <li class="">100% custom License Agreement, No web3 use allowed</li>
        <li class="">100% <b>ALWAYS</b> Keep The Basics FRESH!!</li>
    </ul> 
    <p class=""> It is meant for preproduction stages and heavily focusses on system design (DX/CS), design language (DX/CX), custom DS license distribution ($$), and <b>not</b> as a surface design system (UI/UX) framework like Tailwind, but applies the utility-first approach on the preproduction of any design system. </p><p>Revolver-DS aims to do exactly what all the others forgot; design a language for those who want to start rocking design systems and code, and who like keeping it simple! That's everyone, no?</p>
    <p>Language is the oldest technology, so just <b><i>Lock, Load & Ship it!</i></b> Powered by Revolver-DS, and one dissident Dutch designer named <a href ="https://www.justgu.us.">justgu.us</a>; the tiniest Dutch design system agency, packed inside a human body.</p>
    <p>I love branding, naming and design systems so much, that I started giving an "all guns blazing" <i>applied game design</i> workshop called: <a href="https://followgu.us/workshop">"Naming Things: my DS"</a>. For those that want to learn the true art of design systems <b>onsite</b>; <u>designing a CS pattern language</u> by hand, no code...</p>

    <h1>.: Key Principles :.</h1>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :has(Layers)</h3>
    <p>Revolver-DS strictly uses the @layers feature to prevent any conflict with any class-based DS code, and to keep everything modularly and strictly layered instead of typed. A best practice that designer's know how to do as well, and saves them from "naming things".</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Tokenized)</h3>
    <p>RDS strictly uses tokenized <a href="followgu.us/cssvariables">"Literal, Relative and Lateral"</a> CSS variables. They supercharge the layering of Revolver-DS without JS, as well as create a pleasant dx-experience without being forced to adopt a framework or alienating concept. Use the design system we already have; language!</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Semantical)</h3>
    <p>What does color--600 actually mean? Is it the default, or the base? Numerics don't cut it that way, semantically. This is why Revolver-DS has it's own semantical token notation called .: B.O.U.~M :. that uses a relative --base to start from. Need more? Base plus one. Need less? Base minus one. It works great with fluid typescales like Utopia (included!).</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Accessible)</h3>
    <p>It should require no more than HTML, CSS and a text editor to get started with Revolver-DS. Pen & Paper is how I thought this system out, and in digital it works offline too. Just add <code>.rds</code> to your body element, and poof! </p><p>But what is more important than any of that is the design language is fully semantical, and accessible for non-technical people to get started with. The result: No docs, strictly simple principles to remember by hand.</p></h3>
    
    <h3>EVERYTHING :not(crypto, NFT, web3))</h3>    
    <p><a href="https://followgu.us/boum">.: B.O.U.~M :.</a> is an intellectual IP that protects design system products & product lincensing for free by using design-tokens as legal tender. </p><p>It makes them work like a legal block-chain inside any DS quite literally, without the crypto or burning the planet. Yet it protects any work created by it, yours too, against the use of <i>NFT's, crypto-currency or any SaaS-related software supporting web3.</i></p><p>Just a few kb's of CSS logical properties and HTML, protected by a license agreement on the .: B.O.U.~M :. naming convention IP.</p><p>By attaching a BOUM-tokens to layer your design tokens, combined these tokens are now protected by the <b>FREE</b> <a href="https://followgu.us/license">BOUM DS License </a>. It is a supplement to the Creative Commons 4.0 CC-BA-NC-SA license already included, which protects the destributed and attached BOUM-tokens (my own design system IP). </p><p>This simple and professional license model offers very generous public free tiers for everyday design system use (1st & 2nd degree), has an open source tier (limited 3rd), and professional & paid tiers (3rd & 4th degree) for daily professional who wish to protect their work from web3 misuse. </p>
    <p>Even <i>without a proof of license</i> which is required for professional use, your products are still protected by the Creative Commons license as a fallback, which defaults to non-commercial, share alike. Revolver-DS is and will always be FREE to use for personal and non-commercial educational use.</p><p>Have <a href="https://followgu.us/license#pricing">a look</a> and see for yourself; BOUM prevents <b>NFT and web3 related usage</b> of your licensed and creative work by default! Something no other open source tech license dares to do.</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Headless)</h3>
    <p>Developers, rejoice! This design system :has made your DS my primary customer and contains only two classes; <u><i>.rds and .rds--freeze</i></u>.  Revolver-DS is made with classless CSS, and fully modular @layers so you can lock, load and ship any of it's parts interchangibly any:where! Including the license agreements so many forget. That :is the power of headless CSS design systems, that nothing in your head jams, :not even legal matters.</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :where(Just Works)</h3>
    <p>Revolver-DS is anticipating a trend; to work completely remote and independant. What it means to us is two things; Revolver-DS always works without a connection or dependencies, and second to support development on offline mobile devices. Including the return of Pen & Paper education, no joke.</p><p>This makes RDS perfect for "pure" on the go development such as teaching yourself how to structure a DS without relying on a heavy 3rd party framework or Googling. Designed for daily practice, not prestige. </p><p>Selflearning is the only golden standard today, if not ever, because what else? A post-human design system with all choices made for you, and that legally owns all your IP from the start before you could say "lock.."? </p><p>Lets reclaim our voice, identity and ownership before web3 consumes it, without the need for Revolver-crypto. Just Lock, Load & Ship your lethal and legal DS!</p>
