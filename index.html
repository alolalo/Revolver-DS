    <h3>Lock, Load & Ship, Designers!</h3>
    
    <p class="">Revolver-DS is a <b>simple revolver-themed methodology in CSS</b>; <i>just lock, load & ship</i> your non-destructive Revolver-DS with "the new CSS"! Sounds dangerous and triangulated, and it is!</p> 
    <p>EVERYTHING uses @layers to structure <a href="https://followgu.us/boum">BOUM-tokens</a> using ITCSS, which in turn get loaded correctly and non-destructively in a fresh Revolver-DS <code>@import</code> + <code>@layer</code> combination;</p><pre><code>
        /*style.css*/

        @layer reset, lock, load, ship, preset;

        @import url('../css/lock.css') layer(lock);
        @import url('../css/load.css') layer(load);
        @import url('../css/ship.css') layer(ship);
    </pre></code>
    <p>That's it! Just lock, load & ship your independantly created design system to any developer, and watch them <span style='font-size:2.4ex;'>&#128079&#128079&#128079; </span> for you! And that's not it, you're smoking hot after this bombshell fact;</p>
    <p><i>EVERYTHING</i></b> in Revolver-DS uses <code>@layers</code> to structure <a href="https://followgu.us/boum">BOUM-tokens</a>; a fully semantical and systematical naming convention that uses a relative base to name things on a ramp (100~900). Without conflicts and supports naming fluid scales like <a href="https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/?c=320,15,1.2,1920,25,1.25,5,2,320-640-1024-1440-1920-4096&s=0.75%7C0.5%7C0.25,1.5%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C6%7C8,s-l%7Cl-2xl%7C2xl-4xl%7C4xs-3xs%7C2xs-s%7Cs-l%7Cl-2xl">Utopia Typescales</a> (included!).  </p><p> Need more? Base plus one. Need less? Base minus one. Like an elevator, just go up or down a floor from the color__base; your default color--600 in any other DS. Perfect for naming things IRL with semantics, to avoid numerical conflicts in any mainstream DS.</p>
    <h3>A headless source of Truth </h3><p class="">RDS has no opinionated framework dependencies. From scratch, all the groundwork and theming to structure a modern classless CSS design system is set up for you, including a custom naming convention to prevent conflicts down the line, so anyone can safely import the layers to the single source of truth; the "unknown".</p>
    <p>Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I'm letting the browser fix the issues you're worrying about as a developer, and I'm giving a developer full control over it's head. Revolver-DS is headless by design, by head-first OOP by a designer.</p>
    <h3 class="rds">#KTBF: 7 Principles of RDS </h3>
    <ul class="">
        <li class="">100% <b>free</b> to use, personal or commercial</li>
        <li class="">100% Semantical ITCSS design system language</li>
        <li class="">100% pure CSS & HTML, no (JS) framework</li>
        <li class="">100% NO docs, strictly comments</li>
        <li class="">99,98% classless CSS (two tbh), everything @layers</li>
        <li class="">100% custom License Agreement, No web3 use allowed</li>
        <li class="">100% <b>#KTBF</b>: Keep The Basics FRESH!!</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Revolver-DS aims to do exactly what all the others forgot; create a design system for designers in the same manner as developers do, so there's a seperation of concern upfront "what wins". @layers will fix that! </p><p>
        Future forward; if we use CSS everyone wins if we stop giving people the title "developer" to do so. Said by me, <a href="https://justgu.us">just Guus</a>, who says your voice, identity and ownership of work is yours to begin with. The rest is DRY & SOLID code.</p>
    <p class=""> It is meant for preproduction stages and heavily focusses on system design (DX/CS), design language (DX/CX), custom DS license distribution ($$), and <b>not</b> as a surface design system (UI/UX) framework like Tailwind. </p><p>It plays nicely with any of those out of the box, and you don't need to add Revolver-DS tokens to your config. Just lock & load a <code>.rds /*head*/</code> class onto your <code><body></code>, and ship it with your DS!</p><p>Instead Revolver-DS applies the utility-first approach many developers love on the preproduction of any design system. Designer-first, so their code <b>ships to begin with</b>. Designers don't need to code btw. They need to ship their decissions in tiny clean code that "just works", instead of doing everything in no-code that never works.</p>
    <p>It's a serious attempt to state that designers simply need their own source of truth, that talks to your source of truth. A single source of truth; the "unknown" as a given, forged with a modern non-destructive modular mindset. Design == Code.</p>
    <p>Language is the oldest technology, so just <b><i>Lock, Load & Ship it!</i></b> Powered by Revolver-DS, and one dissident Dutch designer named <a href ="https://www.justgu.us.">justgu.us</a>; the tiniest Dutch design system agency, packed inside a human body.</p>
    <p>I love branding, naming and design systems so much, that I started giving an "all guns blazing" <i>applied game design</i> workshop called: <a href="https://followgu.us/workshop">"Naming Things: my DS"</a>. For those that want to learn the true art of design systems ; <u>designing a DS pattern language</u> by hand, no code, and applied game design to practice it <b>onsite</b>!</p>

    <h1>.: Key Principles :.</h1>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :has(Layers)</h3>
    <p>Revolver-DS strictly uses the @layers feature to prevent any conflict with any class-based DS code, and to keep everything modularly and strictly layered instead of typed. A best practice that designer's know how to do as well, and saves them from naming things technically because "it's code".</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Tokenized)</h3>
    <p>RDS strictly uses tokenized <a href="followgu.us/cssvariables">"Literal, Relative and Lateral"</a> CSS variables. They supercharge the layering of Revolver-DS without JS, as well as create a pleasant dx-experience without being forced to adopt a framework or alienating concept. Use the design system we already have; language!</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Semantical)</h3>
    <p>What does color--600 actually mean? Is it the default, or the base? Numerics don't cut it that way, semantically. This is why Revolver-DS has it's own semantical token notation called .: B.O.U.~M :. that uses a relative --base to start from. Need more? Base plus one. Need less? Base minus one. It works great with fluid scales like Utopia (included!).</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Accessible)</h3>
    <p>It should require no more than HTML, CSS and a text editor to get started with Revolver-DS. Pen & Paper is how I thought this system out, and in digital it works offline too. Just add <code>.rds</code> to your body element, and poof! </p><p>But what is more important than any of that is the design language is fully semantical, and accessible for non-technical people to get started with. The result: No docs, strictly simple principles to remember by hand.</p>
    <p>The technical aspect of accessibility is something Revolver-DS cares deeply about. Yet there are already better systems out there that can do a better job on that level. Second, we anticipate CSS features like color-contrast() to solve this in a native way.</p>
    
    
    <h3>EVERYTHING :is(Headless)</h3>
    <p>Developers, rejoice! This design system :has made your DS my primary customer and contains only two classes; <u><i>.rds and .rds--freeze</i></u>.  Revolver-DS is made with classless CSS, and fully modular @layers so you can lock, load and ship any of it's parts interchangibly any:where! Including the license agreements so many forget. That :is the power of headless CSS design systems, that nothing in your head jams, :not even legal matters.</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :where(Just Works)</h3>
    <p>Revolver-DS is anticipating a trend; to work completely remote and independant. What it means to us is two things; Revolver-DS always works without a connection or dependencies, and second to support development on offline mobile devices. Including the return of Pen & Paper education, no joke.</p><p>This makes RDS perfect for "pure" on the go development such as teaching yourself how to structure a DS without relying on a heavy 3rd party framework or Googling. Designed for daily practice, not prestige. </p><p>Selflearning is the only golden standard today, if not ever, because what else? A post-human design system with all choices made for you, and that legally owns all your IP from the start before you could say "lock.."? </p><p>Lets reclaim our voice, identity and ownership before web3 consumes it, without the need for Revolver-crypto. Just Lock, Load & Ship your lethal and legal DS!</p>
    <h3>EVERYTHING :not(crypto, NFT, web3))</h3>    
    <p><a href="https://followgu.us/boum">.: B.O.U.~M :.</a> is an intellectual IP that protects design system products & product lincensing for free by using design-tokens as legal tender. A smart contract to manage your design tokens, and the attached IP from copyright "mistakes". </p><p>It makes them work like a legal block-chain inside any DS quite literally, without the crypto or burning the planet. Yet it protects any work created by it, Revolver-DS too, against the use of <u><i>NFT's, crypto-currency or any SaaS-related software supporting web3.</i></u></p><p>Just a few kb's of CSS logical properties and HTML, protected by a license agreement on the .: B.O.U.~M :. naming convention. So yes, I did not only make a design system but also my own naming convention(s), and a design system license agreement that's up to date on ethics. I'm a fan of this planet, and you?</p><p>By attaching BOUM-tokens to layer your design tokens, combined your design tokens are now protected by the <b>FREE</b> <a href="https://followgu.us/license">.: B.O.U.~M :. License</a>. It is a supplement to the Creative Commons 4.0 CC BY-NC-SA license already included, which solely protects the destributed and attached BOUM-tokens that in turn are attached to yours. </p><p>This simple, scalable and professional license model offers very generous public free tiers for everyday design system use (1st & 2nd degree) personally & commercially, has an open source tier (limited 3rd), and professional & paid tiers (3rd & 4th degree) for daily professional who wish to use my IP (BOUM) at scale. </p>
    <p>Even <i>without a proof of license</i> which is required for professional use, your products are still protected by the Creative Commons license as a fallback, which defaults to non-commercial, share alike. Revolver-DS is and will always be FREE to use for personal and non-commercial educational use without the hassle if it's not for the hustle.</p><p>Have <a href="https://followgu.us/license#pricing">a look</a> and see for yourself if you need Revolver-DS to hustle; BOUM prevents <b>NFT and web3 related usage</b> of your licensed and creative work by default, for FREE! Something no other open source creative copyright license dares to do, or has even tried to apply (to self).</p>
