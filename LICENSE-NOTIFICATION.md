# License Notification

The following licenses are used and included in this repository inside the root-folder "license";
<ol>
    <li>Creative Commons 4.0 CC BY-NC-SA</li>
    <li>.: B.O.U.~M :. DS license</li>
</ol>
<p>The CC-license is the default license used on all the texts, code, datasets and
all that makes up the .: B.O.U.~M :. IP, represented in BOUM-tokens. This simply means you can use BOUM for anything personal, non-commercially, without a license. </p>
<p>So for a simple side-project; you're good to go without a license, just make sure you accredit appropriately as asual (link to this repository: https://github.com/alolalo/RevolverDS).</p>

## .: B.O.U.~M :. License Notification
<p>BOUM is a FREE license add-on specifically designed to protect work created by a personal or professional design system, in a simple system of THREE degrees of DS user rights & product ownership; </p>
<ol>
    <li>System Product, (limited) 3rd degree (FREE) </li>
    <li>Production Product, 1st degree (FREE) </li>
    <li>End Product, 2nd degree (FREE up to 10k Views, Installs, Prints)</li>
</ol>
<p>Please read or view the "BOUM-license.html" stored in the root-folder "license", or open the .pdf that is stored in the same folder to read up on how it works, and what degree and proof license your product should include. You can get a FREE proof of license (!required) from the <a href="https://www.followgu.us/boumshop">BOUM webshop</a>.
<p>It is the only license to date that protects ALL THE WORK you create from your design system, that use BOUM-tokens, against the use of it for <b>>NFT's, crypto-currency or any SaaS-related products</b> supporting web3. I like this planet, don't you?</p>
<p>A step I felt nobody dared to even make, so I "just did it" and created a very generous freemium DS license and rights distribution model. Based on block-chain design, with just some design tokens as legal tender :)</p>

<p>BOUM-tokens are considerd Intellectual Property to protect it's own IP; a fully semantical & systemical naming convention against copyright infringement on anything the tokens are attached too.</p><p> Why? I don't want my work to be used for web3 stuff, and I love sharing my work too. Personally and Professionally, it makes no difference to me why I should treat either differently. I hope in that sense they serve the many "armies of one", aka indy.</p><p> By attaching BOUM-tokens to your own tokens, you recursively protect your "intellectual property"; the rights to use BOUM-tokens for personal and commercial work, attached to the end of your design tokens. A smart contract for design tokens if you wish.</.>
