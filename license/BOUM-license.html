There are three degrees of usage and user rights, from system product (3rd) to production product (1st) to end-product(2nd), the 4th degree is an extension of the 3rd. The BOUM IP travels in between these identities as seperate legal entities, each having their own rights and claim which will be explained later in this document.</p><h3 id="eb754910-4716-4226-a756-40e6ecb32fe7" class="">The VIP-ceiling: Views, Installs &amp; Prints</h3><p id="eb5067b2-accc-4ba8-ab69-c489e06054ae" class="">The concept of the license model is quite simple; you take the amount of Views, Installs &amp; Prints of an end-product (2nd degree only) using BOUM and look up in the table how big your company size is at the start of the project that is getting licensed.</p><p id="1d036282-aa62-46e2-b6f7-7c49e2b9c4be" class="">These two factors are only important at the start since they determine your entry-point of product license levels, nine in total, and three company-size levels. Once a license is installed, there is no need to upgrade to a “pro” license if your company grows in the meantime.</p><p id="7e000ac3-0ed4-4407-a117-89fb9500a437" class="">BOUM uses your product’s performance hereafter to measure the price you need to pay, as it doesn’t matter if your company grows in teamsize. Your product’s yearly VIP-ceiling level is what counts, an it starts for free up to 10k VIP per year, so if you’re start-up is growing but your product is steady in it’s growth, you don’t have to pay more because your company size increases. Only when your product hits it’s VIP-ceiling.</p><p id="867a790a-6fc7-4d4e-9bfb-c28bc5170ccf" class="">The only degree that needs to take the VIP-ceiling into account is the 2nd degree, unless 1st and 2nd degree are owned by the same person, party or company. The latter situation sees that 1st degree will inherit the VIP-ceiling, and any 2nd degree end-product’s usage adds to their own 1st degree ceiling, and the 1st degree’s ceiling is effectively doubling the price to pay.</p><p id="7d1a04fb-6d7f-4b28-bb0c-7410f4925c70" class="">To not have to pay for any VIP-ceiling cost for any of the products you make for yourself and your company, not 3rd party clients who always have their own VIP-ceiling on 2nd degree end products, you can use a system-license that grants you the exclusive bonus of not having to pay a dime in licensing cost hereafter, and allows unlimited projects to be created with it for inhouse use without having to track licensing cost.</p><p id="475856b0-84d6-4b8d-ad92-556c8e35806a" class="">However, as an indie developer or even a big agency you do NOT need to buy a system-license if you develop for multiple clients, as you CAN create unlimited end-products with a 1st degree license (production product) but no more than two for the same client. </p><p id="7177708e-3d65-444a-864e-c73f8b865906" class="">If you wish to have no restrictions for your customers to buy a system license, this would be your option to choose as well, plus you can create 1st degree products for clients too. 1st Degree is free forever, but limited to redistribution on what you can do with one degree later.</p><h2

<strong>views, installs &amp; prints (V.I.P.) </strong>in an average per year with a ceiling, and ties this to the products created with it. A 1st degree license can create 2nd degree END products with it, but the VIP coming from those accounts to the 1st degree if they are from THE SAME SOURCE. </p><p id="9ab817be-5a0a-4a05-9199-6353d8104dc1" class="">Meaning if you want to own all the rights of your product, you’re a system maintainer of self at scale. In any other case, like a client who recieves your work, the VIP-ceiling only accounts for the 2nd degree end-product.</p><p id="44cb57d7-10fe-4159-a3c6-50f19692ab2e" class="">There are three tiers; indie which has less than 10 people working at the company, pro less than 100, and grow less than 1000. All tiers start free if it’s a new product, existing products that already have an established user-base will enter at a higher level. </p><p id="8a3c859a-f872-4f4b-b31a-cd531a60e1cc" class="">FREE* means this tier is free if you paid all other tiers before that one, so if you happen to enter on the FREE* tier, your fee will still be the level before that one. FREE is actually free, no catch.</p><p id="48219196-a7a2-4b9e-9384-8101ad89b54c" class="">So before you think it’s smart to have 1st and 2nd degree rights on a product, it’s doubling your VIP-bill per product and makes no sense. If you wish to do just that, own all the rights of a product’s licenses (product and system rights) WITHOUT the VIP-ceiling, you need a system-license. </p><p id="f851d12f-59e6-4f18-ac80-3700bcdb1271" class="">Otherwise you just accept a double bill for the reasons you probably have, yet once a product is licensed you can NOT remove the VIP-ceiling. This means you can’t relicense if a product is already licensed, and this applies to all degrees but especially 1st and 2nd degree.</p><p id="bf370741-ba5e-49ed-935a-bf2e2a29f665" class="">System-licenses are the only licenses that do NOT have a VIP-ceiling tied to 1st and 2nd degree products if they are for inhouse use, and there is no limit on the amount of projects you can create from it. If you wish to make a design system for a client that needs to create end products with it, the only license that will create these rights is 3rd degree, not limited 3rd degree that can only create 2nd degree.</p><p id="4c768f93-9684-4816-b1a3-37fbc5baca7e" class="">In case for a client, your client benefits from your license ancestry and you don’t need to “switch license”. You just include their 2nd degree of license ownership, that inherits the rights of 1st degree ownership as the current owner of the 1st degree’s nested IP and 2nd degree ownership of product. </p><p id="e087c055-0597-4701-9d09-47a6da73b7db" class="">Not the production-product, the 1st degree version you used to make the 2nd degree and final end-product.

We NEED to upgrade!” because of their 1st milestone succes; actually getting paid!

You only pay once, like in the good old days. Because if toiletpaper, a necessity, was invented in this era, it would probably come with a lifetime subscription…</p><p id="4d411de1-c491-489a-9b64-e40719a6fda1" class="">Regardles of your company-size, it’s time to upgrade if you have outgrown your license’s ceiling but not your staff. That’s costly enough already, so that is the upside of .: B.O.U.~M :. ‘s business-model; it’s growth focussed by not making you pay for when you grow in size, only in user and production growth.</p><p id="163ca7e0-70f7-441b-ba54-4e6e440a2f74" class="">It’s based on product-performance first, then the company-size.
