## Gravemaker Typescales
#### Dedecated to Thomas Gravemaker's 50yrs of Letterpressing Mentoring & Mastering

Burried by the math behind fluid typescales? 50 yrs of Letterpressing to the rescue! 
Gravemaker.css is a demo of how these actual typescales work in digital, and what the difference is between relative and absolute units in CSS. Their origin is _fluid_ typography (duodecimo), but so is digital (sedecimo) because they had to be pressed on a `square piece` of paper. 

This required a numerical system of **proportional equality** that could support both the typographers needs for designing the iconic symbols of the typeface, but also make the letterpressing a reality by sticking to a formula that could be _interdisciplinairy communicated_. 

Thomas Gravemaker was my mentor for only a short while, and hopefully will remain for as long as possible. He will be privately giving physical workshops that you might be able to book at https://www.letterpressamsterdam.com/ next summer (2022), but for now he's handing things over and I was lucky to get one more workshop with him this year.

I got hopelessly lost at the start coming from digital, as we are use to the **8px** grid, but not used to the 12pt in typography, and why that is used as the root value to **devide the real estate**. Spacings in typography can be so minute because the system behind it supports the layout. And that part is key to creating a great flow of your digital documents too, as we primarely focus on the pixel as the source of truth. Not optimal devisions and flow, like "they" do (typesetters). 

If anything, that would be the aim for for Revolver Design System; to create an optimal flow of import, export and departing from design systems for your next creation. Don't like Gravemaker's way of doing things? Well he's not a big fan of digital either, or Amazon. But I do think it's worthwhile to keep practicing, and so I continue on any "luxery time" I have to dive into it in the applied sense (demos). 

After reading the dutch book _Praktisch Rekenen: voor zetters, drukkers en binders_ by C. Hofmann, I got to learn the math that Thomas was educated with, and knows by heart and hand how to set right each and every time. Perfect, no computer, just by memory and the science behind the math.

This is therefor a the balanced middle-ground to help digital typographers as well as letter-pressers a demonstration how those proportions actually relate in **odds & even** proportions of the root-value. Because it is exactly the root-value that you pick that will set the stage for both your press, and your print. 

In todays field of design, generative design is a much appraised field of craftsmanship. I've personally created a mental model the B.O.U.W.:fork:. that is an abbreviation of the following acronyms; BASE, ON, UNDER, WITH, *fork* that shows the **symmetrical composition** in these models and proportions, but use _proportional equality_ to form these models from the center-out. 

Gridless if you will since the numbers you change in the '--bu--' will actually form the scale & size of the grid, but you can forget about that for a second if you will; what's important about generative design is that the _parametric head-values_ can be easily manipulated to see their effects. Therefor this demo serves as a purpose to see how duodecimo en sedecimo will actually work in generative typography scales, based on traditional scales.
